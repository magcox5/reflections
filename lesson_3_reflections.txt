1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    You would want to use a remote repository if you were away from your computer;
    maybe you're using a shared computer where you don't want to save files.

2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
    stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    When you pull changes, you're bringing those changes down into your working directory.
    If you're working on changes to a file that someone else is changing at the same time,
    you would not want your changes to be superceded by the pull.

3.  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork on GitHub clones a repository of another user into your GitHub repository.  You would use Fork
	     if you do not have permission to change the repository you are cloning from, but you want to 
	     acknowledge the source of the files.
	Clone is used to copy a repository from GitHub to your local machine so you can modify or add to
		 the repository.
	Branch is used to create a new path from the master branch on your repository, so you can add new
	     files that may or may not end up in your final master branch. Say you want to add a new 
	     feature to your program, but you're not sure if you can get it to work.  You could branch off
	     the master and try it out:  if successful, you can merge the changes back into the master.
	     If not, no one else will be impacted by your changes, since you have it on a separate branch.
